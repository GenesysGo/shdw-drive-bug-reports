# Shadow Drive Bug Reports

Welcome to the Shadow Drive Bug Reports repository! We appreciate your help in identifying and reporting any bugs or security issues you encounter while using the Shadow Drive Service. To ensure the responsible disclosure and handling of security vulnerabilities, we ask that you follow the process outlined below.

## Bug Reporting Process

1. Submit a new bug report by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/GenesysGo/shdw-drive-bug-reports/issues/new/choose) in this repository.
2. Please provide a clear and concise description of the issue, steps to reproduce it, and any relevant screenshots or logs.
3. Label your issue as a 'bug' or 'security' accordingly.

**Important**: For security-related issues, do not include sensitive information in the issue description. Instead, submit a pull request to our repository, containing the necessary details, so that the information remains concealed until the issue is resolved.

## Alternative Support Channels

**Security related issues should only be reported through this repository.**

While we strongly encourage the use of this repository for bug reports and security issues, you may also reach out to us via our [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/genesysgo) server. Join the #shdw-drive-technical-support channel for assistance. However, please note that we will redirect you to submit the bug report through this GitHub repository for proper handling and tracking.
